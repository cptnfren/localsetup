# Umbrella and queue (scope-based)

This rule applies when **queue or PRD is in scope** (e.g. user is editing `.agent/queue/**` or references a named umbrella workflow) or when the user explicitly asks to run an umbrella/workflow by name.

## Named workflows

- Workflows have **distinct names**. Execute only on **clear user intent** (e.g. "Please execute the umbrella workflow X", "Run make-it-happen").
- Do not start an umbrella or queue run without the user having asked for it by name or by editing queue/PRD with clear intent.

## Guardrails

- **Impact summary + user confirmation:** Before running **big, complex, or destructive** workflows, present a short impact summary (what will change, what could be affected) and require explicit user confirmation. Do not proceed without user acknowledgment.
- **Scope:** This rule does not activate for routine edits outside `.agent/` or PRD; it activates when queue/PRD is in scope or when a named workflow is invoked.
