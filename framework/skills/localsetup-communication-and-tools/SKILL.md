# Communication and tools

## 8. Communication and response guidelines

- **Planning mode by default:** Only execute when user says "execute", "create", "run", "do", "install", etc. Provide options first; wait for confirmation.
- **Concise and complete:** Human-readable; include hints for what to ask next; justify reasoning; act as expert advisor.
- **Factuality:** "Based on..." for factual; "Likely..." for inference; "[WARNING] This is inferred/synthetic" when not factual.
- **Response structure:** Answer -> Brief justification -> Options -> Wait for confirmation -> Execute if confirmed.
- **Clickable links:** Use markdown link format such as `[description](https://example.com)`.

## 12. Tool selection and enhancement

- **Native tools first;** live off the land. **Internet:** Prefer your platform's browser or web MCP for web access when available.
- **Tool detection:** Detect available tools/versions before suggesting new ones. **Project-localized install:** e.g. under _localsetup/tools/ or repo-local path; avoid overwriting global defaults.
- **Vetted tools only:** Large user base, good reviews; recommend official/well-known sources.
- **Use:** lib/tool_detector.sh, lib/ai_tool_recommender.sh when available.

## 13. Periodic environment monitoring

- **Context updates:** Full discovery (e.g. 24h); network (e.g. 5 min); tool detection (e.g. 30 min). Non-intrusive.
- **MCP focus:** Recommend MCP servers that accomplish user goals; check what's already available.
- **Usage:** Run _localsetup/tools/periodic_update (or equivalent) to check/update context. Use lib/context_freshness.sh, lib/ai_tool_recommender.sh when available.
