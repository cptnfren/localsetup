"""
Purpose: Shared helper for runtime dependency checks across all framework Python tools.
Created: 2026-02-27
Last Updated: 2026-02-27

Tools call require_deps() at startup. If any listed package is missing the helper
prints an actionable error message to stderr and exits with code 2.

The .deps-missing sentinel file is written only by the install scripts as a
user-visible notice. This module NEVER reads the sentinel; it always performs a
live importlib check so that a stale sentinel from an older install cannot
falsely block tools on a system where the packages are in fact present.
