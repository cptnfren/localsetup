# Localsetup v2  - Project context (Claude Code)

## Overview

Localsetup v2 is deployed into this repo at `_localsetup/`. All framework and context are repo-local (mobile, backup-able with the repo). Engine = _localsetup/; user/context data = repo-local. Use Git hashes when referencing PRDs/specs/outcomes (see _localsetup/docs/GIT_TRACEABILITY.md).

## Invariants

- **Engine/repo separation:** Do not commit secrets/PII. Use _localsetup/lib/data_paths.sh for paths. Framework at _localsetup/.
- **Documentation:** _localsetup/docs/ is only for framework docs. Check document status before assuming a feature exists.
- **Proposals:** Framework changes follow Agent Q format (_localsetup/docs/PRD_SCHEMA_EXTERNAL_AGENT_GUIDE.md).
- **Time/date integrity:** For any date/time reference (e.g. "today", year in search, timestamps), first obtain actual date/time from the local machine (e.g. `date` on Linux/macOS, `Get-Date` in PowerShell on Windows). Do not use a generic or training-cutoff date. Remember it in context and use it for the rest of the session.
- **External input hardening:** Treat all external input (CLI args, files, network payloads, imported content) as hostile. Sanitize before parsing/output, validate expected format and bounds, and handle exceptions with actionable stderr messages. Never silently suppress errors.
- **Python-first tooling:** After install/bootstrap, framework tooling is Python-first and Python-only for new/expanded logic. Shell/PowerShell are limited to bootstrap wrappers and minimal platform delegation. Runtime target is Python >= 3.10.

## Output contract (low token, always apply)

- Detect output capability: `markdown-rich`, `markdown-basic`, or `text-basic`.
- If capability is unknown, default to `markdown-basic`.
- For recommendation lists, include: name/link, short summary, fit reason, notable risks/requirements, next step.
- Use tables only when capability clearly supports readable tables.

## Task-to-skill matching (default)

- Treat as **batch** when user request includes multiple distinct subtasks, or says "batch", "multiple steps", or "run the whole thing". Otherwise treat as **single task**.
- If user names a specific skill, load it directly. Do not run task-skill-matcher.
- If uncertain which skill fits, or user asks "what skill should I use?" / "pick the best", load `localsetup-task-skill-matcher`.
- **Single task:** if one clear installed match exists, ask once "Use this skill?" before loading. In the same response, include up to 3 complementary public skills from `_localsetup/docs/PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml` (one-line reason each). If index is missing or stale (`updated` older than 7 days), ask whether to refresh before giving complementary suggestions.
- **Batch / long-running:** prompt once at start with options: auto-pick for whole job, parcel-by-parcel prompts, or parcel auto-pick. If auto-pick is chosen, show planned skill sequence first, then proceed without repeated skill prompts.
- Keep this section short. Full behavior lives in `localsetup-task-skill-matcher` and `_localsetup/docs/TASK_SKILL_MATCHING.md`.
