# Smoke commands per skill for framework audit (skill matrix).
# Schema: skill_id (from _localsetup/skills/<name>/) -> command string or "N/A".
# Command is run with cwd = sandbox copy of the skill (see localsetup-skill-sandbox-tester).
# N/A = doc-only skill; no runnable tooling to smoke. Audit uses agent step summary only.
# Path and schema documented in localsetup-framework-audit SKILL.md.
