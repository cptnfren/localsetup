# Localsetup v2 Framework

**Version:** 2.2.1  
**Last updated:** 2026-02-19

This directory is the engine of Localsetup v2: a universal, cross-platform agentic workflow framework for DevOps, local and remote servers, network configuration, and any workflow that benefits from AI agent assistance on your chosen platform (see [Platform registry](docs/PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md) for the canonical list: Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, OpenClaw). Deployed into your repo, the framework and context live inside the repo so the setup is mobile and backup-able, with no home-directory dependency.

The framework is for anyone who wants to execute tasks with agents: it provides a convenient, contained place for workflows and skills. It is **lightweight**, **does not interfere with existing projects**, and works for a **wide variety of tasks**; it is **compatible with all agentic design patterns** and **platform-independent** -the same skills and workflows run on any supported host.

The emphasis is on **transparency**, **security**, and **high-quality operations** with **traceability**. Use the built-in skills as-is, **create new skills** from your workflow or from existing docs (skill-creator), or **import external skills** from a URL (e.g. GitHub) or local path -the framework discovers and validates them, runs a heuristic security screen, and summarizes each so you choose which to import (skill-importer). Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) specification and are **interchangeable**: use skills from ecosystems like [Anthropic's skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) in this framework, and use this framework's skills in any spec-compliant host. Agents load context and skills by task (decision trees, PRD batches, safety, tmux, versioning, publishing, and more), with human-in-the-loop where needed and git-coupled references for PRDs, specs, and outcomes.

## Overview

**Summary of features:** One-line install (Bash/PowerShell); multi-platform deploy (cursor, claude-code, codex, openclaw); always-loaded context per platform; 32 built-in skills (decision tree, PRD batch, safety, tmux, versioning, publishing, skill-creator, skill-importer, skill-discovery, and more); duplicate/overlap/namespace checks when creating or importing; heuristic security screening on import; public skill registry and index with refresh and top-5 similar recommendations; versioning (VERSION, conventional commits, per-skill metadata.version); cross-platform tools (deploy, verify_context, verify_rules, skill_importer_scan); docs under [docs/](docs/) and [AGENTIC_DESIGN_INDEX.md](docs/AGENTIC_DESIGN_INDEX.md).

Localsetup v2 provides:

- **One always-loaded context** per supported platform (canonical list: [docs/PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md](docs/PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md)) with invariants, skills index, and docs index.
- **Skills** (task-based instructions) that agents load when the task matches -e.g. decision tree, PRD batch, safety, tmux, versioning, publishing. Create new skills from workflows or docs (skill-creator); import external skills from a URL or path with validation and security screening (skill-importer). Skills are [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification)–compliant and interchangeable with other spec-compliant hosts.
- **Named workflows** (decision tree, Agent Q queue, umbrella workflow, manual/lazy admin) with impact review where required.
- **Repo-local everything**: engine at `_localsetup/`, user/context data under the repo; [git traceability](docs/GIT_TRACEABILITY.md) for PRDs, specs, and outcomes so operations stay transparent and auditable.

After installation, the client repo contains `_localsetup/` (this framework plus docs) and platform-specific paths at repo root (e.g. `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/skills/` for Cursor). Version displayed in READMEs and framework docs is kept in sync with the repo **VERSION** file by the repository maintainers.

---

## Installation

Installation is run from the **repository root** (parent of this `_localsetup/` directory), not from inside `_localsetup/`.

**Linux / macOS (Bash):**

```bash
# Interactive
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cptnfren/localsetup/main/install | bash

# Non-interactive (agents/CI)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cptnfren/localsetup/main/install | bash -s -- --directory . --tools cursor --yes
```

**Windows (PowerShell):** After cloning or downloading the repo, from the repo root:

```powershell
# Interactive
.\install.ps1

# Non-interactive
.\install.ps1 -Directory . -Tools cursor -Yes
```

On Windows, if you run the Bash `install` from Git Bash, it **detects the host** and delegates to `install.ps1` automatically. See [Multi-platform install](docs/MULTI_PLATFORM_INSTALL.md) for full cross-platform details.

**Options:**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--directory PATH` | Client repo root (default: `.`) |
| `--tools LIST` | Comma-separated: `cursor`, `claude-code`, `codex`, `openclaw` |
| `--yes` | Non-interactive; no prompts (required when using `--tools`) |
| `--help` | Print usage and exit |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Cursor only, non-interactive
install --directory . --tools cursor --yes

# Cursor + Claude Code
install --tools cursor,claude-code --yes

# Interactive (prompt for directory and tools)
install
```

**What gets deployed:**

- **All platforms:** Framework at `_localsetup/` (tools, lib, docs, skills, templates).
- **Per-platform** context and skills paths: see [docs/PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md](docs/PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md) (single source of truth for supported platforms and paths).

See [Multi-platform install](docs/MULTI_PLATFORM_INSTALL.md) for details.

---

## Requirements

- **Linux/macOS:** Bash (for install, deploy, and framework scripts). **Windows:** PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core (for `install.ps1` and `*.ps1` tools).
- **Git** (for install clone/update; optional for `verify_rules`).
- One or more platforms from the [platform registry](docs/PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md) (e.g. cursor, claude-code, codex, openclaw), selected via `--tools` / `-Tools`.
- **Optional (Python):** To run the public skill index refresh (`tools/refresh_public_skill_index.py`), install deps from `_localsetup/requirements.txt` (e.g. `pip install -r _localsetup/requirements.txt`). Only needed if you refresh `PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml` locally.

## Skills

Skills are task-based instructions (SKILL.md with `name` and `description` frontmatter). Agents load the appropriate skill when the task matches. Same skill content is used across all platforms; the deploy step copies from `_localsetup/skills/` to the platform path (e.g. `.cursor/skills/` for Cursor).

| Skill | When to use |
|-------|--------------|
| `localsetup-decision-tree-workflow` | User says "decision tree", "reverse prompt"; editing `.agent/queue/**`, PRD |
| `localsetup-agentic-umbrella-queue` | Queue/PRD in scope; named workflows; impact summary + confirmation |
| `localsetup-agentic-prd-batch` | "Process PRDs", "run batch from PRD folder"; implement per spec, outcome |
| `localsetup-public-repo-identity` | Editing README*, CONTRIBUTING*; public identity |

| `localsetup-automatic-versioning` | Version bumps, release workflow, conventional commits, versioning docs |
| `localsetup-github-publishing-workflow` | Publishing to GitHub, public release prep, publishing checklist, repo readiness |
| `localsetup-skill-creator` | Create new skill from workflow or existing doc/markdown/GitHub; capture workflow as framework skill |
| `localsetup-skill-importer` | Import skills from URL or local path; discover, validate, screen, summarize; user picks which to import |
| `localsetup-skill-discovery` | Discover public skills from registries; recommend top 5 similar when creating/importing; in-depth summary, use public, continue, or adapt |
| `localsetup-task-skill-matcher` | Match task intent to installed skills; recommend top matches; single-task confirm once; batch auto-pick/parcel flow; complementary public-skill suggestions |

Skills follow the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification) specification and are interchangeable with other spec-compliant hosts (import from URLs or local path; export framework skills for use elsewhere). See [SKILLS_AND_RULES.md](docs/SKILLS_AND_RULES.md), [PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md](docs/PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md), [SKILL_INTEROPERABILITY.md](docs/SKILL_INTEROPERABILITY.md), and [SKILL_IMPORTING.md](docs/SKILL_IMPORTING.md) for platform paths, loading behavior, and import/export.

---

## Tools

Run from **client repo root** (so that `_localsetup/` is present). When the repo is cloned into `_localsetup/`, tools live under `_localsetup/_localsetup/tools/`. On **Linux/macOS** use the Bash scripts; on **Windows** use the `.ps1` scripts (or run the Bash scripts from Git Bash -they detect Windows and delegate to the `.ps1` versions).

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `deploy` / `deploy.ps1` | Write platform-specific context loaders and skills. Usage: `deploy --tools "cursor,claude-code,codex,openclaw" --root /path/to/client/repo` (Bash) or `deploy.ps1 -Tools "cursor,claude-code" -Root "C:\path"` (PowerShell). Normally invoked by the install script. |
| `verify_context` / `verify_context.ps1` | Verify Cursor context file exists (`.cursor/rules/localsetup-context.mdc`). |
| `verify_rules` / `verify_rules.ps1` | Check git repo, data_paths (sh/ps1), and skills directory. |
| `skill_importer_scan` / `skill_importer_scan.ps1` | Scan a directory for Agent Skills; output per-skill brief (what it does, what it has, code types) and heuristic security flags. Use after fetching a URL or for a local path; then use skill-importer workflow to let the user select which skills to import. |

---

## Libraries and configuration

- **`lib/data_paths.sh`** / **`lib/data_paths.ps1`**  - Path resolution: engine dir, project root, user data dir, ensure user data dir. Use in scripts for repo-local paths. Respects `LOCALSETUP_PROJECT_ROOT`, `LOCALSETUP_FRAMEWORK_DIR`, `LOCALSETUP_PROJECT_DATA`.
- **`lib/json_formatter.sh`**  - JSON formatting helpers for Bash scripts.
- **`discovery/core/os_detector.sh`** / **`discovery/core/os_detector.ps1`**  - OS detection (Linux, macOS, Windows) for cross-platform behavior.
- **`config/defaults/system_config.yaml`**  - Defaults: `framework_folder: _localsetup`, `user_data_subdir: .localsetup-project`.

---

## Workflows

| Workflow | Description | When to use | Impact review |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Master rule / context | Always-loaded framework context | Always | No |
| Decision tree | One Q per turn, 4 options A–D, preferred + rationale | User says "decision tree" or "reverse prompt" | No |
| Agent Q (queue) | Process specs in `.agent/queue/`; implement, status, outcome | "Process PRDs", "run batch from PRD folder" | Yes if destructive |
| Umbrella workflow | Multi-phase single kickoff; named workflows | User invokes by name | Yes for big/destructive |
| Manual (lazy admin) | Human-in-the-loop; three-block format; info-gather before destructive | Sudo, confirmation, manual steps | No (protocol is guardrail) |

See [WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md](docs/WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md) and [AGENTIC_DESIGN_INDEX.md](docs/AGENTIC_DESIGN_INDEX.md) for details.

---

## Verification and testing

From **client repo root** (when the repo is cloned into `_localsetup/`):

**Bash (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
./_localsetup/_localsetup/tools/verify_context
./_localsetup/_localsetup/tools/verify_rules
./_localsetup/_localsetup/tests/automated_test.sh
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
.\_localsetup\_localsetup\tools\verify_context.ps1
.\_localsetup\_localsetup\tools\verify_rules.ps1
.\_localsetup\_localsetup\tests\automated_test.ps1
```

The automated test runs path resolution, OS detection, and checks for `lib/`, `tools/deploy`, and `skills/` under the engine directory.
