# Platform registry (Localsetup v2)

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for which AI agent platforms the framework supports. When you need to list supported platforms, reference this file instead of scattering names across docs. When adding a new platform, add it here first; when registering a new skill, use the "Skill registration (new skills)" list below so no platform is missed.

**Deploy flag:** The install/deploy scripts use platform **IDs** (e.g. `cursor`, `claude-code`, `codex`, `openclaw`) in the `--tools` / `-Tools` option. Values must match the **ID** column.

## Supported platforms

| ID | Display name | Context loader (path in client repo) | Skills path (path in client repo) |
|----|--------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| cursor | Cursor | .cursor/rules/localsetup-context.mdc (and .cursor/rules/localsetup-context-index.md) | .cursor/skills/localsetup-*/ |
| claude-code | Claude Code | .claude/CLAUDE.md | .claude/skills/localsetup-*/ |
| codex | OpenAI Codex CLI | AGENTS.md (repo root) | .agents/skills/localsetup-*/ |
| openclaw | OpenClaw | _localsetup/docs/OPENCLAW_CONTEXT.md (merge into workspace MEMORY.md if desired) | skills/localsetup-*/ (repo root) |

*More platforms may be added later. Update this table and the "Skill registration (new skills)" section when adding one.*

## Skill registration (new skills)

When adding a new framework skill, register it in **every** file below so the skill appears in each platform’s context and in the framework README. Paths are relative to the **framework source root** (the directory that contains `templates/`, `skills/`, `docs/`).

Add one row or bullet per new skill with a short "When to use" description. Use the same phrasing everywhere.

| Platform / scope | File to update |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Cursor (templates) | framework/templates/cursor/localsetup-context-index.md |
| Cursor (templates) | framework/templates/cursor/localsetup-context.mdc |
| Cursor (deployed copy) | framework/.cursor/rules/localsetup-context-index.md |
| Cursor (deployed copy) | framework/.cursor/rules/localsetup-context.mdc |
| Claude Code | framework/templates/claude-code/CLAUDE.md |
| Codex | framework/templates/codex/AGENTS.md |
| OpenClaw | framework/templates/openclaw/OPENCLAW_CONTEXT.md |
| Framework README | framework/README.md (Skills table) |
| Context skill (source) | framework/skills/localsetup-context/SKILL.md |
| Context skill (Cursor copy) | framework/.cursor/skills/localsetup-context/SKILL.md |

**If you add a new platform:** extend the Supported platforms table above, add the platform’s context/skills paths, and add the corresponding registration file(s) to this table so the skill-creator and maintainers keep all platforms in sync.

## Reference

- Deploy script: `_localsetup/tools/deploy` (Bash) / `deploy.ps1` (PowerShell); accepts `--tools "cursor,claude-code,codex,openclaw"`.
- Skills and rules (paths and model): _localsetup/docs/SKILLS_AND_RULES.md.
