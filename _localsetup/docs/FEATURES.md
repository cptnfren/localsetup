## 📦 Engine and deployment

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Repo-local engine** | The entire framework lives at `_localsetup/` inside your project. Clone or move the repo and everything travels together. No home-directory state, no cloud dependency. |
| **Cross-platform installers** | Bash installer for Linux and macOS; PowerShell installer for Windows. Both support interactive and non-interactive modes. |
| **Multi-host deployment** | Deploy context and skills to Cursor, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex CLI, or OpenClaw from a single install command. |
| **Idempotent updates** | Re-running install updates the framework (via git pull) and redeploys context. Safe to run repeatedly. Deploy can overwrite root-owned destination files (content is updated; a metadata warning may appear). |
| **Platform registry** | A single Markdown table ([PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md](PLATFORM_REGISTRY.md)) defines every supported platform ID, context path, skills path, and memory file location. Add new platforms by editing one file. |
| **Global deployment** | Deploy once to user-wide locations (`~/.kilo/skills/`, `~/.openclaw/`, `~/.claude/`) and use the framework across all projects. Auto-detects installed agents when `--global` is used without `--tools`. Repo-local installation takes precedence over global. |

## 🧠 Agent memory management

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Persistent memory bank** | Each platform deploys with a writable memory file for AI agent learnings. Unlike `AGENTS.md` (which is write-protected), the memory file is freely writable. |
| **Platform-specific locations** | Memory files at `.kilo/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.claude/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.opencode/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, `.cursor/rules/agent-memory.md`, `.agents/AGENT_MEMORY.md`, and `AGENT_MEMORY.md` (OpenClaw root). |
| **Strict curation rules** | Maximum 20 entries per section; revise existing entries don't append; stale entries (>30 days) are deleted; only record patterns confirmed in 2+ sessions. |
| **Global and repo-local memory** | Memory can be deployed globally (shared across projects) or repo-locally (versioned with the project). Repo-local takes precedence. |
| **Memory references in context** | Each platform's context file references its memory file with curation rules, prompting the AI to actively manage memory. |
| **Documentation:** | Full guide at [MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md](MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md). |

## 🛠️ Skills and interoperability

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Agent Skills spec compliance** | All shipped skills follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification). Import skills from Anthropic's repo or any spec-compliant source. |
| **Shipped skills** | Debugging, TDD, PR review, git recovery, Linux triage, Linux patching, Ansible orchestration, codebase navigation (agentlens), tmux ops (pick/probe/send), system-info, cron-orchestrator, PRD batching, decision trees, humanizer, KeePass secrets, and more. See [SKILLS.md](SKILLS.md) for the full catalog. |
| **Skill importing** | Import external skills from a GitHub URL or local path. The importer discovers, validates, runs a heuristic security screen, and summarizes each skill before you decide to add it. Imported skills are always normalized per [SKILL_IMPORTING.md](SKILL_IMPORTING.md) and the `localsetup-skill-importer` skill. |
| **Skill discovery** | Maintain a public skill registry ([PUBLIC_SKILL_REGISTRY.urls](PUBLIC_SKILL_REGISTRY.urls)) and index ([PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml](PUBLIC_SKILL_INDEX.yaml)). Get recommendations for similar public skills when creating or importing. The discovery workflow includes a mandatory post-refresh scrub step that catches dead URLs, stub/placeholder descriptions, and schema gaps automatically. |
| **Skill version metadata** | Each `SKILL.md` carries a `metadata.version` field. The commit hook auto-increments patch version on staged skill changes so skill docs stay accurate. |
| **Skill normalization** | Normalize imported or in-tree skills: Phase 1 (documents) offers a choice when the skill is platform-specific (keep as is, keep platform-specific but normalized, or fully normalize); Phase 2 (tooling) rewrites bundled scripts to the framework standard unless the user requests an exception. Normalization is mandatory for imported skills (run as part of the import flow) and available as a standalone step via the `localsetup-skill-normalizer` skill. |

## 🔄 Workflow and quality controls

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Decision tree workflow** | A reverse-prompt process where the agent asks one question at a time with four options, a preferred choice, and rationale. Builds context before implementation. |
| **PRD batch workflow** | Process specs from `.agent/queue/` (or structured `in/`); implement per spec, update status, write outcomes, and reference the PRD schema. |
| **Workflow registry and quick reference** | Central registry of named workflows with IDs, names, aliases, and impact review expectations in [WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md](WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md), plus an agent-facing quick reference in [WORKFLOW_QUICK_REF.md](WORKFLOW_QUICK_REF.md) with common-phrase mapping and composite pipelines so agents can invoke multi-step workflows by intent. |
| **Composite pipelines (built from skills)** | Predefined multi-step flows that reuse existing skills: PR feedback loop (`pipeline-pr-feedback-loop`), git repair and hygiene (`pipeline-git-repair-hygiene`), server triage and patch (`pipeline-server-triage-patch`), and repo polish (`pipeline-repo-polish`). Documented in [WORKFLOW_QUICK_REF.md](WORKFLOW_QUICK_REF.md) and the workflow build spec, they provide higher-level workflows without new engine code. |
| **Agent Q bidirectional** | Bidirectional PRD exchange over file_drop or mail: file_drop ingest of OpenPGP outer blobs, registry validation, ledger, quarantine on failure, key generation via gpg batch, mail adapter post-ingest move via mail skill. PRD schema, queue pattern, and protocol are explicitly wired together: see [PRD_SCHEMA_EXTERNAL_AGENT_GUIDE.md](PRD_SCHEMA_EXTERNAL_AGENT_GUIDE.md) for PRD shape and field mapping, [AGENTIC_AGENT_Q_PATTERN.md](AGENTIC_AGENT_Q_PATTERN.md) for queue layout, and [AGENTIC_AGENT_TO_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md](AGENTIC_AGENT_TO_AGENT_PROTOCOL.md) plus [AGENTIC_AGENT_Q_SCENARIOS.md](AGENTIC_AGENT_Q_SCENARIOS.md) for transport behavior. Client: `_localsetup/tools/agentq_transport_client/`. |
| **Framework compliance** | Checklist-based workflow for framework-safe modifications: certainty assessment, context load, document status, testing, git checkpoints. |
| **Script and docs quality** | Markdown encoding standards, script generation quality rules, file creation discipline, and documentation discipline enforced by the `localsetup-script-and-docs-quality` skill. |
| **Human-in-the-loop ops** | The tmux shared-session workflow uses the tmux_ops tool (pick, probe, send, wait). Pylon-guard delay prevents command racing; `send --wait` or standalone `wait --timeout N` provides adaptive idle polling. Human can attach and provide sudo; agent captures output via log files. Supports REMOTE_TMUX_HOST for VMs/remote/Docker. See [ops/tmux-ops-remote.md](ops/tmux-ops-remote.md). Use for privileged or risky operations. |
| **Tmux-default terminal mode (Always-On-TMUX)** | Toggleable feature (`tmux_terminal_mode enable/disable/status`) that makes new terminals open inside a tmux session automatically and injects a mandatory tmux + sudo gate rule for agents. Two modes: `--mode ide` (Cursor/VS Code terminal profile) and `--mode shell` (bashrc/bash_profile auto-attach). Can be used as an \"always-on tmux\" layer for this repo or machine. Single command to enable or disable; backups created before any file is modified; idempotent. See [TMUX_TERMINAL_MODE.md](TMUX_TERMINAL_MODE.md). |
| **Arbiter workflow** | Push decisions to Arbiter Zebu for async human review when you need approval before proceeding. |
| **Framework audit** | Single entrypoint runs doc checks, link checks, skill matrix (sandbox smoke from `skill_smoke_commands.yaml`), version/facts. Output only to user-specified path; no in-repo default. Entrypoint: `run_framework_audit.py --output /path`. Deep Analysis (`--deep`) is not implemented in the current script; see [WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md](WORKFLOW_REGISTRY.md) and skill `localsetup-framework-audit`. |
| **Public skill index maintenance** | Named workflow (trigger: \"refresh skills\", \"refresh and scrub\", \"update public skill index\") that runs the full three-step sequence: (1) refresh from registries, (2) dry-run scrub to detect stubs and dead URLs, (3) apply fixes. Implemented by `refresh_public_skill_index.py` and `skill_index_scrub.py`. See [SKILL_DISCOVERY.md](SKILL_DISCOVERY.md). |

## 🔢 Git, versioning, and traceability

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **Conventional commit bumping** | Version bump is inferred from commit messages (feat: → minor, fix:/docs: → patch). Framework version and docs are maintained by repo maintainers; see [docs/VERSIONING.md](../../docs/VERSIONING.md). |
| **README and docs sync** | Version values are synchronized to `README.md`, `_localsetup/README.md`, and YAML frontmatter in `_localsetup/docs/*.md` and `docs/*.md`. |
| **Attribution guardrails** | The commit hook strips `Co-authored-by` trailers for AI agents and bots. Only humans appear in commit history. |
| **Git traceability model** | PRDs, specs, and outcomes can reference git commit hashes for audit. See [GIT_TRACEABILITY.md](GIT_TRACEABILITY.md). |
| **Maintenance workflow** | Framework version and docs are maintained by the repository maintainers. See [docs/VERSIONING.md](../../docs/VERSIONING.md) for how version is defined and displayed. |
| **Skill metadata patching** | Skill `metadata.version` in SKILL.md is updated by maintainers when skills change; see [AGENT_SKILLS_COMPLIANCE.md](AGENT_SKILLS_COMPLIANCE.md). |
